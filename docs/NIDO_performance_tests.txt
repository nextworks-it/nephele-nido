The CSV files report the performance of the NIDO orchestrator when operating over a 3 DCN cluster at varying request frequency.
The exact numbers are reported in the following:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ DCNs			| 3   +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Pods per DCN		| 10  +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Planes per DCN	| 2   +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Tors per Pod:		| 10  +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Servers per Tor	| 2   +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Nodes per DCN		| 120 +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Servers per DCN	| 200 +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Servers (total)	| 600 +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Inter-DCN nodes	| 9   +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Nodes (total)		| 369 +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each test has been perfomed by sending random path requests to the NIDO orchestrator for 10 minutes at a different rate:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+  Test number  +  Reqs/s  +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|       1       +    0.2   +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|       2       +    0.5   +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|       3       +    1.0   +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|       4       +    1.5   +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|       5       +    2.0   +

The csv files report the following values obtained during the corresponding test:

- Average of the path instatiation time (i.e. total time from request to active path)
- Maximum path instatiation time
- Minimum path instatiation time
- Standard deviation of the path instatiation time
- Average of the path computation time (i.e. time needed to compute a path through the DCN graph)
- Maximum path computation time
- Minimum path computation time
- Standard deviation of the path computation time
- Average of the path provisioning time (i.e. fraction of the instantiation time spent waiting for the domain controller to instantiate the intra-domain paths)
- Maximum path provisioning time
- Minimum path provisioning time
- Standard deviation of the path provisioning time
- Average of the Julius path instatiation time (i.e. time required by Julius to instantiate a path on the inter-DC network)
- Maximum path Julius instatiation time
- Minimum path Julius instatiation time
- Standard deviation of the Julius path instatiation time
- Average of the Julius path instatiation time (i.e. time required by Oceania to instantiate a path on the DC network)
- Maximum path Julius instatiation time
- Minimum path Julius instatiation time
- Standard deviation of the Julius path instatiation time
